# CalendlyBlazorAPI
This project uses the Calendly API to grab all events and inputs them into a custom calendar. The calendar goes forward and backwards through the months and has onclick functions to get the previous or upcoming events in Calendly. The Get Events tab also uses the API but ouputs the data into a table along with extra information like the amount of participants for an event.
